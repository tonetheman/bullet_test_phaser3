- DONE: player has concept of health
- DONE: show health in scene

- make sure player can die
- player death should stop the scene movement
- need a way to restart the scene after death

- need collisions with melee bads to kill/harm player
    - current bads are melee only

- need example casting bad
    - need to make sure casting bads can cause harm/kill player
    - be nice to have circular casting bullets (changes to collision detection)
    - get bullets to work first
